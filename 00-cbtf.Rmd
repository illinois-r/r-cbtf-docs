# Accessing RStudio in _CBTF_

To access _RStudio_ in the Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF), please go
to upper left corner of your monitor and press `"Applications"`. In the
drop down menu that appears, mouse over the `"Programming"` submenu. This
opens up another menu that shows the different program editors available.
Please click on the `"RStudio"` menu item.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cbtf-rstudio-location.png")
```

When _RStudio_ opens, you will see **red text** indicating that _CRAN_ cannot
be reached. **This is okay and is by design to meet the CBTF security model
requirements.** All packages required by STAT 385, STAT 430 DSPM, STAT 432,
and CEE 202 have been pre-installed on the CBTF computer.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cbtf-rstudio-view-startup.png")
```

# Creating an RMarkdown Document

Please keep your work in an _RMarkdown_ document. To create an _RMarkdown_
document, press the "White Plus" on the green background in the upper left
corner and go down to the "R Markdown..." entry.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cbtf-create-rmarkdown.png")
```

This will open a window asking what kind of _RMarkdown_ document you would like.
Type in the `Title:` field `"CBTF Exam"` and then press okay.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cbtf-rmarkdown-input.png")
```

From there, you should be ready to go! Please wait for the **proctors** to tell
you when to being the exam. We wish you the best of luck and good ability on
your exams and quizzes using _R_!

# Common Errors

Below are some common errors appear from time to time when 
attempting to use _R_ and _RStudio_ in the CBTF.

### Package Installation

**Avoid trying to install packages**. As was shown in the beginning, 
the package installation feature is disabled within the CBTF. Courses that use
_R_ in the CBTF have all the necessary components for their assessments.

### Accessing Data

Pay close attention to where data is saved. Make sure to place the data file
in the same folder that contains the _RMarkdown_ or _R_ Script to ensure it
is able to be read in. Failure to do so may result in the data set not
being found. These errors would look like:

```r
Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(file, "rt") :
  cannot open file 'bad/path/to/data.rds': No such file or directory
```

### R Session Aborted

When writing more advanced code, RStudio may crash during its execution.
The crash error will look like:

```{r rstudio-crash, out.width="60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-session-aborted.png")
```

This indicates that there is a show-stopping bug in the code being executed. 
Try to either debug the code or start from scratch and slowly build it up. 

The proctors inside the CBTF **cannot** provide debugging assistance.
